**Assumptions**:

* You're studying CS or you're in a related field
* You want to become a frontend developer
* You're willing to put in a bit of extra work outside your curriculum to improve your chances of getting hired

Don't worry, this won't be an another post that discusses whether going to college is worth it for developers. That is highly individual and I'm in no position to argue for or against any of the options. If you are going to college, though, I argue that it is important to supplement your studies by studying on your own. Here's the why and how.

## Theory and Practise Are the Same in Theory, but Not in Practise

As funky as this sounds, I find it extremely applicable here. University education should prepare you for your future career as a programmer or an academic. College should give you a solid foundation on core computer science concepts and principles: algorithms and data structures, networking, operating systems, math, software architecture, different paradigms (OOP and FP), etc. The premise here is that by knowing this you won't have any problems whatsoever learning something new and choosing this route, in our case it's frontend engineering/development. It's true in theory, but is it in practise?

### Benefits of Going to College for CS education

If you focus solely on your studies, you'll most likely do well in school. You'll get good grades and get more opportunities to become a researcher or a teaching assistant (TA) if you want to. That's great if you're into that kind of stuff. If you want to become a frontend engineer, odds are your GPA isn't going to matter and employers will test your problem solving abilities and look at your past experience to determine whether they want you or not. You might ask yourself at this point if college is necessary at all for frontend developers, but it's important to remember the undisputed benefits of actually getting that degree: networking, internship opportunities, and developing a study/work ethic.
