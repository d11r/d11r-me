A lot has happened over the last four years - I've completed my  Computer Science (CS) studies at [Innopolis University](https://innopolis.university/en/), published over a dozen academic papers, successfully finished an internship with Facebook in London, and more. This article summarizes the highlights of my journey.

## Choosing where to study

I got my high school diploma in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but I was determined to study abroad after that. After a friend of mine got a scholarship from Innopolis University for his tremendous accomplishments in competitive programming, I decided to apply as well. After a series of interviews, I got an offer to study there, with a scholarship on top.

The decision to study at Innopolis University (IU) was not an easy one to make, but reflecting back, it was the right one for me. IU is located in [Innopolis City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innopolis) (built in 2012), in the Republic of Tatarstan, in Russia. That's over 2500km away from home. The distance and the class schedule meant that I'd get to come home twice a year - once during the winters for 1 month, and once during the summers for 3 months.

One huge plus that IU had going for itself was that both the classes and the exams were completely in English. This meant that I didn't need to spend time learning a new language before the semester starts. In addition, I really liked that the university is new, and this means that the curriculum is likely not going to be outdated. They gave scholarships to a lot of talented individuals, so that also meant that I got to meet many self-driven and enthusiastic people along the way.

On the other hand, I disliked the fact that there is pretty much nothing to do in the city. In fact, when I got there in 2017, it barely had a supermarket. Now the situation is a bit different, but at the time, going to Kazan (the closest big city, approx. 1hr away by bus) was a must for all the shopping and entertainment.

But all in all, I thought the pros beat the cons. I get to concentrate on my studies, and when I finish all my exams I get to come back home and spend some quality time with family and friends. All that while receiving a monthly scholarship allowing me to become more and more financially independent. So I accepted the offer and in the Fall of 2017 I officially became a freshman of Innopolis University.

## Curriculum and the structure of courses

I really loved the curriculum when I first saw it. It had everything I thought was vital for every software engineer: plenty of math and many CS courses (both theoretical and practical). We also had quite a lot of elective courses to choose from and that meant that I got to learn about some things outside the standard curriculum (e.g. I took a course called *Human and Animal Brain Representation in Neurosciences* which was extremely cool and informative). You can find the whole curriculum [here](https://apply.innopolis.university/en/bachelor/).

Courses were usually organized as a combination of theoretical lectures in big auditoriums and labs. I loved attending lectures, they were usually interactive and gave us, the students, an opportunity to gather and hang out before and after. I found labs to be generally very useful as well, particularly for highly technical subjects.

Most of the courses had assignments, and even though they used to be quite stressful and hard, that's where I got most of the knowledge from. When I think of it, they also taught us to structure our thoughts and communicate the ideas clearly. Some courses had essays and they were fantastic learning opportunities as well (e.g. *Game Theory and Introduction to AI by [prof. Brown](https://twitter.com/jb03hf)*, and many more).

## Doing research while studying

When I was a freshman studying at Innopolis University I immediately got curious about ongoing lab projects and asked some of the professors how I could help. Soon after, when I pitched them a new idea about machine-to-machine micropayments, they were impressed and asked me to develop a prototype showcasing how this would work.

A couple of weeks later, the prototype was ready and professors got really interested. Next thing I know, five professors join the project and start contributing new ideas and tell me that the idea is promising and that it is worth it to publish our observations. So we did, in [2018 IEEE iThings conference in Halifax, NS, Canada](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8726727)!

This is what taught me how rewarding and fulfilling conducting research can be. Since then, I have [published over a dozen papers to conferences and journals](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=za-b-mYAAAAJ), I spoke at international conferences, and I got student research competition awards. My latest one is an article published in [PeerJ Computer Science](https://peerj.com/computer-science/), a Q1 journal, and you can find it [here](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-625/). You can find and read my papers/articles on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=za-b-mYAAAAJ).

## Internship at Facebook in London

As I also wanted to experience industrial work and how companies build consumer-facing products, I wanted to challenge myself and get in one of the most popular and prestigious organizations in the world, Facebook. Managing Facebookâ€™s scale is an enormous engineering effort that requires a lot of specialized knowledge in various areas of computer science. Making an impact while contributing to the mission of giving people the power to build community and bringing the World closer together was truly a dream of mine.

In the Summer of 2021 I interned at the company as a front end engineering intern and the experience has been nothing short of amazing. I met many amazing people, stayed for 3 months in one of the best cities on Earth, and generally had a blast working there.

## Summary

Looking back, studying at Innopolis University has proven to be a correct step for me. Not only did I learn so much from world-renowned professors, but I also got to conduct research at two separate laboratories, and have the opportunity to interview with and intern at a big tech company.

Receiving the scholarship and working in a lab at Innopolis University have allowed me to focus less on the finances, and to go all-in on studying and preparing myself for the next steps. Studying at IU really built my confidence that I'll be able to achieve almost anything I set out for myself.

No regrets.
