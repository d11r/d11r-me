A lot has happened over the last four years - I've completed my  Computer Science (CS) studies at [Innopolis University](https://innopolis.university/en/), published over a dozen academic papers, successfully finished an internship at a big tech company in London, and more. This article summarizes the highlights of my journey.

## Choosing where to study

I got my high school diploma in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but I was determined to study abroad after that. After a friend of mine got a scholarship from Innopolis University for his tremendous accomplishments in competitive programming, I decided to apply as well. After a series of interviews, I got an offer to study there, with a scholarship on top.

The decision to study at Innopolis University (IU) was not an easy one to make, but reflecting back, it was the right one for me. IU is located in [Innopolis City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innopolis) (built in 2012), in the Republic of Tatarstan, in Russia. That's over 2500km away from home. The distance and the class schedule meant that I'd get to come home twice a year - once during the winters for 1 month, and once during the summers for 3 months.

One huge plus that IU had going for itself was that both the classes and the exams were completely in English. This meant that I didn't need to spend time learning a new language before the semester starts. In addition, I really liked that the university is new, and this means that the curriculum is likely not going to be outdated. They gave scholarships to a lot of talented individuals, so that also meant that I got to meet many self-driven and enthusiastic people along the way.

On the other hand, I disliked the fact that there is pretty much nothing to do in the city. In fact, when I got there in 2017, it barely had a supermarket. Now the situation is a bit different, but at the time, going to Kazan (the closest big city, approx. 1hr away by bus) was a must for all the shopping and entertainment.

But all in all, I thought the pros beat the cons. I get to concentrate on my studies, and when I finish all my exams I get to come back home and spend some quality time with family and friends. All that while receiving a monthly scholarship allowing me to become more and more financially independent. So I accepted the offer and in the Fall of 2017 I officially became a freshman of Innopolis University.
