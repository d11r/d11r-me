I decided to become a software developer when I was about 14. That's when I wrote my computer program in QBasic. Fast forward almost ten years, I earned a software engineering degree and got a full-time software engineering job at a big tech company. This article describes what happened in between.

## Early days

I guess I was very fortunate to know where I want to be when I finish school. We had a subject called *Informatics* back in elementary school, and I loved it! Now that I think of it, it was probably the only subject where I intentionally researched more that it was sufficient to pass the course with an A. I was truly interested in how this all worked. I could tell a computer to do something. I got hooked.

## My first real software projects

When it came to picking a high school to enrol in, for me it was an easy choice. I wanted something where I could do computer programming. It just so happened to be that a local high school had a 4-year track that covered programming and other aspects related to software development. The first two years of it, though, were focused on exploring sciences and liberal arts.

As you can imagine, things I could write and create were rather rudimentary. I began using Pascal and C++, so that was a step-up, but still, I was mostly making console-based apps. I got bored. I wanted to make more exciting things. But, we haven't studied how to make [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) apps yet! This meant that I needed to put in extra effort aside from my high school curriculum to be able do make interesting projects. When I look back, this was the pivotal moment where I embraced self-study and began trying to make apps people could use: desktop apps, mobile apps, and web apps.

## Making iOS apps

I had a 2011 iMac. It was a phenomenal machine back in the day. I just loved the form factor it provided - a big screen and all the computer internals packed in a monitor-shaped device. I loved it. I had some trouble following the coursework on it as everyone and their mother were using Windows. But I figured it out. This enabled me to do things I was fairly sure nobody in my city was able to do - write iOS and macOS apps! I didn't have an iPhone at the time, but my father had an iPad. So, I decided to write something that could be run on my dad's iPad. I went with, extremely popular at the time, [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird). And I learned sooo much!

As you can imagine, going from a very simple environment of using a command line to run 100-line programs to real-world development using XCode and Objective-C (and Swift later) wasn't exactly the smoothest experience. I had to learn a plethora of things - architectural patterns for building apps (MVC in my case), handling graphical elements (images, sprites, native UI elements like buttons, labels, etc.), user interactions, and much more. I was overwhelmed, but I never stopped researching these concepts because building this game was so much fun! This is when I truly fell in love with programming.

By the time I finished building this app, we got to more complex concepts in our high school curriculum: websites with PHP and HTML, relational databases, operating systems, and more. These things were very intuitive and easy to grasp because I spent so much time learning all about different computer science concepts earlier. At this point I had a very good general idea of how everything fits together. Or, so I thought.

Soon after, I got contacted by a friend asking me whether I want to build an iOS app as part of a bigger family of products for a famous singer from Serbia. I was extremely excited, and I said yes! The next couple of weeks I was coding it out, and in retrospect, it was just plain terrible. The bundle size for this very small app was about 80MB, it was slow, didn't work for all iPhones, but it worked somehow. Most of it had to be rewritten later by a more experienced developer. But I'm still amazed that they let someone with 0 experience work on a project like this. The app wasn't a joke though - it had to communicate with an API, had some weird menu animations, photo gallery, and much more. There is no way I could have known how to properly do this when I was 17. This was a pivotal moment for me as I quickly learned so much: interacting with designers to make an app come to life, interacting with a backend dev to get data from there, all that while making sure I deliver something that works to management.
